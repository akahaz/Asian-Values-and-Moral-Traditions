## Topic 2
### Pre-Qin Confucianism Mencius and Xunzi
Both Mencius and Xunzi are descendants of the pre-Qin Confucian Confucius. Mencius advocated "remove profit and embrace righteousness", and vigorously promoted "righteousness", and put forward "the theory of good nature". Xunzi, on the other hand, was an opponent of Mencius. He proposed "controlling profit with righteousness" against "removing profit and cherishing righteousness", and advocated the significance of "profit" to people, and put forward the "theory of evil nature" against the theory of "the theory of good nature".

## Topic 3
### Daoism Laozi and Yang Zhu
Taoism is very mysterious and highly respected in China. And Lao Tzu was the first person who coined the term Taoism and studied what Tao is. Taoism has a strong individualism and is strongly opposed to Confucianism. Beyond that, Taoist thought is largely built around relative moralism. Those who study this theory believe that everything in the world is relative, that when there is goodness, there must be evil, and when there is benevolence, there must be unkindness. And Yang Zhu was the one who perfected this theory and pushed it into the mainstream of society. He takes "I" as the center of everything, and believes that the government should not harm the interests of the people, and everything should be free and open. He gave up Laozi's "fewer desires" and opposed Confucianism's "self-denial and restoration of rituals", and believed that people should continue to enjoy themselves in the world and feel all the good things in the world.
